## Contribution Flow

Do you have an improvement?
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

* Fork the repo and create a topic branch from `master`.
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
* Submit a pull request to the original repository.

Thanks for your contributions!
